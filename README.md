# Whackathon Hackathon Project

We decided to go with the Brendan Howard prompt.

The key words in the prompt were "information accuracy" for "making decisions".

Our idea is to create a browser extension that analyses news headlines and social media news feeds to determine their accuracy by giving each article a rating and then assigning 'Gen Z friendly' badges to each article.
